    "Note that the attempt to [use OpenAI to parse the screenplay](./LLM_StructuredOutput_Screenplay.ipynb) failed with a `ContentFilterError`. Either flagged as copyrighted work or something else. Switching to a proper parser. One of the risks with using OpenAI or any LLM for that matter, is that you need to catch the hallucinations _(gpt-4o-mini, for instance, was making up some dialogues. Caught it entirely by accident)_. So might need a proper parser in any case. However, given that it tooke me almost 3 days to get the parser cleaned up and the LLM could figure out the format instantly, I am looking at a large amount of time investment if I come across other formats for screen-plays. At that point, worth investing in installing a local LLM _(Ollama, TGI etc)_ and see if those also fail with ContentFilter error. For now, moving on.\n",
