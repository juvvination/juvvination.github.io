# Red Teaming

This term came up when I can learning about building a chatbot with RAG. It seemed to be about protecting yourself you prompt injection attacks.

WHen I looked it up, I found a course on `deeplearning.ai` which had the following summary

## What is Red Teaming

Course: https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/red-teaming-llm-applications/

> Learn how to test and find vulnerabilities in your LLM applications to make them safer. In this course, youâ€™ll attack various chatbot applications using prompt injections to see how  the system reacts and understand security failures. LLM failures can lead to legal liability, reputational damage, and costly service disruptions. This course helps you mitigate these risks proactively. Learn industry-proven red teaming techniques to proactively test, attack, and improve the robustness of your LLM applications.
