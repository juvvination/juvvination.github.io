# Unleashing the Emergent Cognitive synergy in LLMs: A task-solving agent through multi-persona self-collaboration

ðŸ‘‰ **TODO.. Continue from the paper on Page 4. I am not entirely convinced this is that useful as-is. An actual agentic apprach will be atleast as good as this while being way more flexible. Will get back to this as needed.**

> ðŸ‘‰ Main takeaway is that you can get the effect of multiple-personas and feedback loop based refinement on a single LLM without needing agents. Lack of observability etc when using non-agentic approaches is there but this might be transferable over to agents too.

 > They call it SPP _(Solo Performance Prompting)_ but the word solo clashes immediately with _multi_ from _Multi Persona_. I will likely only remember it as _MPP: Multi Persona Prompting_ wherease their `solo` likely comes from this being all done in a single LLM. Very confusing!

## Creative writing example
This illustrates the high-level approach.
